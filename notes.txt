most popular web framework for python
tons of features (admin site, object-relational mapper (ORM), authentication, caching)

front-end is part that is loaded into a web browser on client's machine
back-end is part that runs on web server and responsible for data processing and handling client requests

HTTP is the protocol for how clients and servers communicate
servers can respond in 2 ways:
    1. server generates page and returns html page to client
    2. (Best practice) server generates and returns data to the client
    and pushes responsibility to the client to do things with data (using front end frameworks)
    
If using best practice, need the server to provide an API to clients so that clients can access this data
Django allows us to build APIs

everytime creating a django project, need to set up a new virtual environment
so workflow is as follows:
    make a new directory for the project
    pipenv install django
    to activate virtual environment, run pipenv shell
    django-admin is used to do many things?
    django-admin startproject [project name]

everytime register a new django app with django-admin startapp [app name], need to register it in settings.py file (INSTALLED_APPS)
urls.py in main project folder is the overall url handler

python manage.py runserver/startapp/etc. is different from django-admin runserver/startapp/etc. because it is run through a project directory and
runs it using manage.py in the command to ensure that the command knows about the project configurations and settings. using the second command
can be used outside of a project directory and is used to create apps that can be installed by any project

python manage.py [makemigrations] to write migration file,[migrate] to update database
if [store] app is at migration 0004, can downgrade it by saying python manage.py migrate store 0003 (this will not change the code, just the migration file)
to undo changes to code though, still need to delete the added code because if makemigrations again it will just add back the code changes
